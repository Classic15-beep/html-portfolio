<h1>The OP Animes of All Time</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 OP Anime of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>HunterxHunter</h3>
<p>What an amazing anime. The character Killua was really something else.</p>

<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>Top Notch. I really admired Asta's never-ending strength of not giving up.</p>

<h3>Wind Breaker</h3>
<p>Spectacular is how i would put it. The fights, characters, and plot was way out of this world.</p>
